To create a Discord bot that can transcribe speech to text and save it as a file, you can follow these general steps:

1.	Create a Discord bot using a bot token provided by Discord. You can use a library like Discord.py or Discord.js to create the bot.

2.	Use a speech-to-text transcription library like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or Amazon Transcribe ( here, we use Google API) to convert the audio from the user's speech to text. You will need to provide an audio file as input to the library. You can use a library like FFmpeg to convert the audio from the Discord voice channel to the required format.

3.	Once you have the text output from the speech-to-text transcription library, you can save it as a file using Python's built-in file handling functionality. You can choose to save the file in any format you like, such as plain text or a structured data format like JSON.

4.	You can then use the Discord bot to send the text file to the desired location, such as a specified Discord channel or to a cloud storage service like Google Drive or Dropbox. You can use APIs provided by these services to programmatically upload the file.

5.	Finally, you can add error handling and logging to the code to make sure the bot functions properly and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
